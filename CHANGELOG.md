# RVE 2.3.2
### Added
 - Fallback to float32 if float16 does not work with custom arch.

 - Slow upscale.
# RVE 2.3.0
### Added
 - PyTorch MPS Support for MacOS (Special thanks to Gold John King on RVE Discord for testing the code)
 - AniSD model suite.
### Changed

 - Improve Startup Time.
 - Update TensorRT to 10.10

### Fixed
 - Fixed ROCm installation not launching on linux.
 - Fix completely black output using specific resolutions with tensorrt. 
 - Fix auto cropping.

# RVE 2.2.5
 - Updates backend and python version.
 - Lock to make sure the app does not have duplicates open.
 - Switchable pytorch backend and version.
 - Blackwell GPU support. 
 - Selectable upscale scale independent of model scale.
 - Custom ffmpeg args in front end.
 - Windows installer.
### Changed
 - Installes to a preset directory, and updates python and backend dynamically.
 - Improved RIFE TensorRT speeds
 - Bump torch to 2.7
 - Bump ROCm to 6.3
 - Bump CUDA to 12.8
 - Enabled tensorrt and torch in flatpak.
 - No more terminal running when using RVE on windows.
### Fixed
 - Fixed HDR Mode
 
# RVE 2.2.0 
### Added
 - Hardware Encoding
 - Auto border cropping
 - GPU ID selection
 - Default video container setting
 - Batch input support
 - Full fallback on TRT upscaling, so the engine has the greatest chance of building correctly.
 - Additional Codec Support (Video, Audio, Subtitle)
 - Additional Animation and Realistic Models
 - Option to reencode audio, in case it has issues with output.
 - HDR Mode toggle (experimental)
### Changed
 - Adjusted dynamic scale.
 - Moved pausing to shared memory.
 - Changed checks on default output directory.
 - Optimized engine building for interpolate and upscale at the same time, should now use less VRAM.
 - Improved tooltips.
 - Adjusted default scene detect sensitivity to 3.5.
 - Bump torch to 2.6.0
 - Bump numpy to 2.2.2
 - Bump tensorrt to 10.7
### Fixed
 - Win10 tooltips and pop ups.
 - Issue when DAR is not equal to SAR (Thanks Yasand123).
   
# RVE 2.1.5
